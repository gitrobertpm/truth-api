But all those unobserved events feel kind of sad in a way, like a silent movie flickering in an empty theater.  Moreover, what success is likely to be found in a life that goes largely unexamined?  Consider the card player who sits at the table and places large bets without an agile knowledge of the game.  How shall they fare compared to the sharp, who knows the odds and the math and the poetry of the game?  Not knowing how to play the game of life can get you killed.  Conversely, an intimate understanding that can only come from close examination can give life just the advantage it needs to truly flourish and shine.`,
